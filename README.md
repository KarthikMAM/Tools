# CodeGen
C++ Menu driven program code generator implemented in C#

This is an application that will generate a "menu driven program" template in c++ for the menus that you give as input. The methods that we ant to implement can be built over it and called in the individual switch cases meant for that menu. This will speed up the completion of the lab exercises faster and also to get an elegant output(to satisfy my teachers).
